# STOPMYCANCER.COM — README (v1)
**StopMyCancer — Your cancer. Explained. Supported. Navigated.**  
**Free. Global. Female-first. No false promises.**

StopMyCancer.com is **not** a cure claim.  
It is **not** “miracle” content.  
It is **not** supplement marketing.  
It is **not** inspirational fluff.

StopMyCancer.com is:

> A clinically-grounded, plain-language cancer guide — built to help women and families understand, navigate, and advocate through diagnosis and treatment **without misinformation**.

This README defines the **mission, guardrails, site architecture, safety rules, editorial tone, page templates, and the flagship “Pathology Report Translator” feature**.

---

## 0) Core Reframe (Non‑Negotiable)

### The name carries urgency. The mission carries truth.

**StopMyCancer** must never imply:
- guaranteed cure
- specific outcomes
- treatment superiority

StopMyCancer means:
- **stop the confusion**
- **stop the isolation**
- **stop the misinformation**
- **stop the delays**
- **stop the dismissal**
- **stop the system from losing you**

Primary tagline (use everywhere):
> **“Your cancer. Explained. Supported. Navigated.”**

Secondary line (optional):
> **“Female-first oncology, built for real life.”**

---

## 1) What StopMyCancer Is (and Is Not)

### StopMyCancer IS:
- a plain-language medical encyclopedia (with citations)
- a navigation tool for diagnosis → treatment → survivorship
- an identity + access equity lens (global + underserved)
- a story library designed for safe learning and emotional support
- a “2am guide” for questions, next steps, and advocacy

### StopMyCancer is NOT:
- medical advice
- a replacement for clinicians
- a place for unverified treatments
- a platform for supplements, detoxes, or conspiracies
- a free-for-all forum

Rule:
**Safety beats virality. Always.**

---

## 2) The Mega‑Site Architecture (Built to Scale)

StopMyCancer scales through four pillars:

### A) The Medical Encyclopedia (Plain-language, deep)
The “Wikipedia layer,” but readable and cited.

Covers:
- cancer types (site-specific and systemic)
- staging, grading, biomarkers
- imaging and labs
- surgery / chemo / radiation / immunotherapy / targeted therapy / hormone therapy
- side effects and symptom management
- recurrence and metastasis (careful framing)
- fertility, pregnancy, menopause
- pain, fatigue, sexuality, mental health
- palliative care, hospice (with clarity and compassion)

**Everything here must be evidence-based and cited.**

---

### B) The Human Library (Stories at scale, safely structured)
Not random blogs. A structured library.

Stories are indexed by:
- cancer type
- age / life stage
- country / health system context
- treatment path
- identity and access factors
- family role (patient, daughter, partner, caregiver)

Rule:
Stories are **never** treated as medical guidance.
They are lived experience and emotional reality.

---

### C) The Identity + Access Layer (The missing piece)
StopMyCancer becomes globally meaningful here.

Examples:
- Black women and breast cancer outcomes
- Indigenous screening barriers
- Trans and nonbinary oncology navigation
- Rural vs urban access
- Migrant language barriers
- Disability + cancer care
- Neurodiversity + medical trauma
- Cultural norms around bodies, modesty, and consent

Tone:
Not politics. Reality.

---

### D) The Navigation Layer (Most practical)
This is the “2am utility.”

Topics include:
- how to get diagnosed (step-by-step)
- what questions to ask
- how to read pathology terms
- how to get a second opinion
- how to advocate in appointments
- how to handle dismissal and bias
- chemo/radiation scheduling survival
- caregiver scripts and family conversations
- financial survival resources (by country)
- organizing documents, meds, symptom logs

Goal:
**People leave with next actions.**

---

## 3) Female‑First Oncology (The Defensible Niche)

StopMyCancer is explicitly centered on:
- female bodies and hormone realities
- fertility, pregnancy, postpartum
- menopause and endocrine impacts
- caregiving mental load
- safety, consent, trauma-aware care
- poverty and access patterns affecting women

Important:
Female-first ≠ excluding others.
It means the default lens is women’s lived medical reality, and inclusive content is built with respect.

---

## 4) Trust & Safety Framework (Non‑Negotiable)

### A) Anti‑Misinformation Rules
Hard bans:
- cure claims (“cured my cancer with ___”)
- “detox” / “alkaline” / “parasite cleanse” claims
- conspiracy content (anti-medical institutions narratives)
- supplement marketing / affiliate programs for unproven products
- anti-vaccine content
- “secret cures” narratives

All health claims require:
- primary evidence (guidelines, trials, reviews)
- citations
- editorial review

---

### B) Medical Liability Guardrails
Every medical page must include:
- “not medical advice” disclaimer
- “talk to your clinician” next-step box
- “when to seek urgent care” warnings (where relevant)
- references list (human-readable)

---

### C) Story Safety Rules
Stories must be:
- clearly labeled as personal experience
- moderated for unsafe advice
- separated from guidance pages

Add story tags like:
- “Personal experience — not medical advice”
- “Contains discussion of side effects”
- “Mentions treatment decisions (context only)”

---

## 5) Evidence Standard (Sources & Review)

StopMyCancer must operate with a clear evidence ladder:

**Tier 1 (preferred):**
- national/international clinical guidelines
- major cancer centers’ patient education
- systematic reviews / meta-analyses
- randomized trials (when relevant)

**Tier 2:**
- high-quality observational studies
- reputable registries and statistics sources (contextualized)

**Tier 3 (limited):**
- expert consensus when evidence is evolving (clearly labeled)

Governance:
- clinician advisory board (review + escalation)
- medical editor role (quality + consistency)
- citation policy and update cadence

---

### What it does
- highlights stage/grade terms (if present)
- explains biomarkers and abbreviations
- clarifies typical implications (never definitive)
- produces a doctor-question checklist
- suggests what specialist to ask about (e.g., oncologist, surgeon, genetic counselor)
- links to relevant encyclopedia pages

### What it must NEVER do
- diagnose
- predict survival
- recommend a specific treatment plan
- override clinician advice
- claim certainty

### Safety requirements (non-negotiable)
- explicit disclaimer on every output
- “confirm with your care team” banner
- escalation prompt: “If you have severe symptoms, seek urgent care”
- clinician review of the tool logic and outputs
- audit logs + continuous monitoring for harmful outputs

---

## 9) Product Principles (The Vibe)

StopMyCancer should feel like:
- calm
- brilliant
- loving
- adult
- grounded
- direct
- never patronizing
- never fear-based

Avoid:
- “you got this!” spam
- toxic positivity
- “warrior” clichés (optional, avoid by default)
- medical brochure voice
- doom tone

Style rules:
- short sentences
- clear headers
- checklists
- definitions
- next-step boxes

---

## 10) Global & Free (The Mission Moat)

StopMyCancer should be built for the world:

- lightweight pages (low bandwidth)
- multilingual support
- low-data mode
- printable PDFs
- offline packs (downloadable modules)
- clear reading levels + “deep dive” toggles

This can become one of the most accessed cancer resources globally if it’s fast, honest, and safe.

---

## 11) Monetization (Only if it doesn’t corrupt trust)

Preferred models:
- donations / sponsorships with strict firewall
- grants
- nonprofit / public-benefit structure (optional)
- “support the tool” memberships (no paywall for core safety info)

Not allowed:
- supplements
- “miracle” products
- affiliate links to unproven therapies
- ads that conflict with medical trust

Rule:
**Trust is the product.**

---

## 12) The One Rule That Protects Everything

StopMyCancer must always do three things:

1) **Tell the truth**
2) **Reduce panic**
3) **Increase agency**

If a page doesn’t do all three, it doesn’t ship.
