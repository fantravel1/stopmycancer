            <section class="summary">
              <p><strong>Cancer treatment works, but it often comes with side effects.</strong> Nausea, fatigue, hair loss, pain, and cognitive changes are common. This guide covers what to expect, how to manage side effects, and when to talk to your medical team about them. You don't have to suffer through treatment—there are real strategies that help.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <h2>Side Effects Are Not Your Fault—And Many Are Manageable</h2>
              <p>If your treatment is causing side effects, that doesn't mean something is wrong with you. It means the treatment is working—it's just that cancer drugs affect healthy cells too. The good news: many side effects can be prevented, reduced, or managed.</p>
              <p><strong>Tell your doctor about every side effect.</strong> Don't try to tough it out silently. Your medical team has medications, techniques, and strategies to help. Reporting side effects isn't complaining—it's essential information for your care.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <h2>Fatigue (Cancer-Related Fatigue)</h2>
              <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Extreme tiredness that doesn't improve with rest. Not like normal tiredness—you can feel exhausted after minimal activity.</p>
              <p><strong>Why it happens:</strong> Treatment damages cells and triggers inflammation. Your body is working hard to repair itself and heal.</p>
              <p><strong>How to manage it:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Pace yourself:</strong> Plan important activities for when you have more energy (usually morning). Break tasks into smaller steps.</li>
                <li><strong>Gentle movement:</strong> Paradoxically, moderate exercise (walking, gentle yoga) often helps fatigue more than rest. Ask your team what's safe.</li>
                <li><strong>Sleep hygiene:</strong> Maintain a regular sleep schedule. Avoid screens before bed. Keep your bedroom cool.</li>
                <li><strong>Nutrition:</strong> Eat protein-rich foods to help your body repair itself. Stay hydrated.</li>
                <li><strong>Prioritize:</strong> Say no to non-essential activities. Let people help you.</li>
              </ul>
              <p><em>Fatigue usually improves after treatment ends, but it can take weeks or months. Be patient with yourself.</em></p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <h2>Nausea and Vomiting</h2>
              <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Chemotherapy and radiation can trigger nausea, sometimes leading to vomiting.</p>
              <p><strong>How to manage it:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Anti-nausea medications:</strong> Modern anti-nausea drugs are very effective. Take them preventatively, not just when you're nauseous.</li>
                <li><strong>Eat small, frequent meals:</strong> Large meals can trigger nausea. Smaller snacks throughout the day are often tolerated better.</li>
                <li><strong>Ginger:</strong> Ginger tea, ginger candies, or ginger supplements can help. Discuss with your doctor before starting.</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid trigger foods:</strong> Greasy, heavy, or overly sweet foods often worsen nausea. Stick to bland, cool foods.</li>
                <li><strong>Acupressure:</strong> Some people find acupressure wristbands helpful for nausea.</li>
                <li><strong>Distraction:</strong> Watching a movie, listening to music, or engaging in conversation can reduce nausea.</li>
              </ul>
              <p><em>Nausea usually improves over the course of treatment as your body adapts. Tell your doctor if it's not controlled—there are other medications to try.</em></p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <h2>Hair Loss (Alopecia)</h2>
              <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Some chemotherapy drugs damage hair follicles, causing temporary hair loss (scalp, eyebrows, eyelashes, body hair).</p>
              <p><strong>When it happens:</strong> Usually starts 2-3 weeks after treatment begins and regrows after treatment ends.</p>
              <p><strong>How to manage it:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Scalp cooling:</strong> Hypothermia caps worn during treatment can reduce hair loss by limiting drug exposure to hair follicles. Discuss with your team.</li>
                <li><strong>Wigs:</strong> Many insurance plans cover wigs. Organizations like the American Cancer Society provide free wigs.</li>
                <li><strong>Scarves, hats, headwraps:</strong> Comfortable, fashionable options many people prefer to wigs.</li>
                <li><strong>Eyebrow makeup:</strong> If you lose eyebrows, eyebrow pencils or powder can help. Consider microblading before treatment if you want semi-permanent eyebrows.</li>
                <li><strong>Gentle hair care:</strong> While you have hair, use soft brushes and mild shampoos. Avoid heat styling and chemical treatments.</li>
              </ul>
              <p><em>Hair regrows after treatment. Usually it comes back within 3-6 months. Some people notice it's different—curly if it was straight, different color—but this usually normalizes.</em></p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <h2>Mouth Sores (Mucositis)</h2>
              <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Chemotherapy can damage cells lining your mouth, causing sores, pain, and difficulty eating.</p>
              <p><strong>How to manage it:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Mouth rinses:</strong> Salt water or baking soda rinses (1/2 teaspoon in 8oz warm water) can soothe and prevent infection. Rinse after meals and before bed.</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid irritants:</strong> Skip spicy, acidic, hot, or rough foods. Avoid mouthwash with alcohol. Don't smoke or chew tobacco.</li>
                <li><strong>Soft foods:</strong> Smoothies, yogurt, mashed potatoes, applesauce are gentle on the mouth.</li>
                <li><strong>Topical treatments:</strong> Numbing gels, coating agents, or special oral rinses can reduce pain. Ask your doctor or dentist.</li>
                <li><strong>Dental care:</strong> Brush gently with a soft toothbrush. Tell your dentist you're in treatment.</li>
              </ul>
              <p><em>Mouth sores usually improve as your treatment progresses. Severe sores can sometimes require treatment adjustments—tell your doctor.</em></p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <h2>Peripheral Neuropathy (Nerve Damage)</h2>
              <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Some chemotherapy drugs damage nerves in hands and feet, causing tingling, numbness, or pain ("pins and needles" sensation).</p>
              <p><strong>How to manage it:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Report it early:</strong> Tell your doctor immediately if you develop neuropathy. Sometimes dose reduction or drug changes can prevent worsening.</li>
                <li><strong>Protect yourself:</strong> Be careful with hot water (test temperature first). Avoid tight shoes. Inspect feet daily for cuts.</li>
                <li><strong>Medications:</strong> Gabapentin, pregabalin, or other nerve pain medications can help. Discuss with your doctor.</li>
                <li><strong>Physical therapy:</strong> Occupational and physical therapy can help with balance and function.</li>
                <li><strong>Acupuncture:</strong> Some people find acupuncture helpful for neuropathy.</li>
              </ul>
              <p><em>Some neuropathy improves after treatment ends, but it can be slow. Some long-term effects are possible. This is why early reporting is important.</em></p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <h2>Bone Pain and Joint Pain</h2>
              <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Some cancer drugs (especially some targeted therapies and immunotherapies) cause aching in bones and joints.</p>
              <p><strong>How to manage it:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Pain medication:</strong> Over-the-counter pain relievers (acetaminophen, ibuprofen if your counts are safe) or prescription pain medication.</li>
                <li><strong>Heat and ice:</strong> Warm baths, heating pads, or ice packs can provide temporary relief.</li>
                <li><strong>Gentle stretching:</strong> Light stretching and movement often help more than complete rest.</li>
                <li><strong>Preventive medication:</strong> Some doctors prescribe preventive medication before you experience pain. Ask about this.</li>
              </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
              <h2>Cognitive Changes ("Chemo Brain" or "Cancer Fog")</h2>
              <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Difficulty concentrating, forgetfulness, slower thinking. It's real, it's common, and it's not your imagination.</p>
              <p><strong>How to manage it:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Lower expectations temporarily:</strong> Don't try to do complex mental work. Use lists and reminders.</li>
                <li><strong>Establish routines:</strong> Keep things in the same place. Develop habits so you don't have to remember.</li>
                <li><strong>Be gentle with yourself:</strong> This usually improves after treatment. Most people fully recover their cognitive function.</li>
                <li><strong>Cognitive rehabilitation:</strong> If it persists, ask your doctor about cognitive therapy or rehabilitation.</li>
              </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
              <h2>Low Blood Counts</h2>
              <p><strong>What it is:</strong> Chemotherapy damages bone marrow, which produces blood cells. This can lead to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Anemia (low red blood cells):</strong> Causes fatigue, shortness of breath, dizziness.</li>
                <li><strong>Low white blood cells (neutropenia):</strong> Increases infection risk. You'll need to take precautions (hand washing, avoiding crowds).</li>
                <li><strong>Low platelets (thrombocytopenia):</strong> Bleeding/bruising risk. Avoid contact sports, sharp objects.</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>How to manage it:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Colony-stimulating factors (CSF):</strong> Injections that help your body make more white blood cells. Very effective at preventing infection.</li>
                <li><strong>Blood transfusions:</strong> If needed for severe anemia or low platelets.</li>
                <li><strong>Iron-rich diet:</strong> Help your body make red blood cells (red meat, spinach, beans).</li>
                <li><strong>Precautions:</strong> Avoid crowds during periods of low white blood cells. Good hand hygiene.</li>
              </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
              <h2>Emotional and Mental Health Side Effects</h2>
              <p><strong>What you might experience:</strong> Depression, anxiety, grief, anger, fear. These are very real side effects of cancer treatment.</p>
              <p><strong>How to manage it:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Talk to your oncology team:</strong> Mental health is part of your cancer care. Ask about counseling, therapy, or psychiatric support.</li>
                <li><strong>Support groups:</strong> Talking with others going through cancer treatment can be incredibly helpful. Many are free.</li>
                <li><strong>Therapy or counseling:</strong> Consider working with a therapist specializing in cancer. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is particularly effective.</li>
                <li><strong>Medication:</strong> Anti-anxiety or antidepressant medications can help during treatment. There's no shame in this.</li>
              </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="urgent-box">
              <h2>When to Call Your Doctor Right Away</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>Fever over 100.4°F (38°C)—sign of infection that needs immediate attention</li>
                <li>Severe pain not controlled by medication</li>
                <li>Difficulty breathing or chest pain</li>
                <li>Vomiting that prevents you from keeping down water or medication</li>
                <li>Severe bleeding or bruising</li>
                <li>Suicidal thoughts or severe depression</li>

            <section>
              <h2>Key Points to Remember</h2>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Side effects are common, but that doesn't mean you have to suffer.</strong> There are treatments and strategies for every side effect.</li>
                <li><strong>Report every side effect to your team.</strong> Don't minimize or hide them. This information is crucial.</li>
                <li><strong>Side effects are temporary.</strong> Most improve significantly after treatment ends.</li>
                <li><strong>Your oncology team includes specialists in managing side effects.</strong> Oncology nurses, social workers, nutritionists, therapists—use these resources.</li>
                <li><strong>You're not weak if side effects affect your daily life.</strong> You're human, undergoing intense medical treatment. Give yourself grace.</li>
              </ul>
